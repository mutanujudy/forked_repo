#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a disciplined approach to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software systems.
Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry
It emphasizes on quality on every stage of development.
Software engineering practices help design systems that can scale smoothly, accommodating increased loads and more users without performance degradation.
Software engineering practices help design systems that can scale smoothly, accommodating increased loads and more users without performance degradation.
Software engineering promotes collaboration among different stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and clients.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Decade of the Advent of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
Structured programming emerged from the beginnings of organization theory and information systems, with roots in software design, during the late 1960s as attempts were made to slow down productivity degradation that had been observed in many large computer software development projects. Structured programming, fostered with E. Dijkstra's seminal "Go To Statement Considered Harmful", promoted the use of nested program structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), over flat code often identified as spaghetti at that time; This approach is one of the reasons code was easier to understand, debug and maintain which laid the foundation for current software practices.

2. The Birth of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software engineering by introducing the concept of "objects" — encapsulated data and behavior within classes. Languages like Smalltalk and later C++ and Java popularized this paradigm, which focused on modeling software around real-world entities and their interactions.OOP enabled more modular, reusable, and scalable software designs. It became a fundamental principle in software engineering, influencing everything from system architecture to design patterns. The rise of OOP also facilitated the development of complex software systems, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and large-scale enterprise applications.

3. The Agile Manifesto (2001)
In 2001, a group of software developers published the Agile Manifesto, which proposed a set of values and principles for software development focused on iterative progress, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), prioritize working software, customer collaboration, and flexibility over rigid planning and documentation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
This initial phase involves defining the project’s objectives, scope, resources, timeline, and budget. Stakeholders and project managers assess feasibility, identify potential risks, and create a detailed project plan. This phase sets the foundation for the entire development process.
2. Requirement Analysis
During this phase, the needs of the users and stakeholders are gathered and documented. The focus is on understanding what the software needs to accomplish. Functional and non-functional requirements are specified, serving as the basis for the design and development phases.
3. Design
In the design phase, the software’s architecture is defined. This includes designing the system’s overall structure, components, user interfaces, databases, and data flow. High-level design (HLD) and detailed design (DD) documents are often created to guide developers in implementing the system.
4. Implementation (Coding)
The actual coding of the software takes place during this phase. Developers translate the design documents into source code using programming languages. This phase is where the software is built and where most of the technical work is concentrated.
5. Testing
After coding, the software is tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is free of bugs. Various testing methods (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing) are used to identify and fix issues. The goal is to ensure the software functions correctly and meets quality standards.
6. Deployment
Once the software has passed testing, it is deployed to the production environment where users can start using it. Deployment can involve various activities such as installing the software, migrating data, and training users. This phase also includes setting up the production environment and ensuring that all systems are operational.
7. Maintenance
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for any issues or bugs that need to be resolved. Maintenance includes making updates, enhancements, and modifications to keep the software relevant and functioning well over time. This phase ensures the software continues to meet user needs as they evolve.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be completed before moving on to the next while Agile is an iterative, incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, customer collaboration, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-understood, stable requirements that are unlikely to change, such as developing a software system for regulatory compliance while Agile is well-suited for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as developing a consumer-facing mobile app where user feedback is continuously incorporated.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Writing code, Design Implementation, Debugging and Troubleshooting
Quality Assurance Engineer- Manual and Automated Testing of softwares, Defect Identification and Reporting, Compliance Verification.
Project Manager- Project Planning, Team Coordination, Risk Management, Project Delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comprehensive environment where developers can write, edit, debug, and test code all in one place. Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection reduce the time spent on coding and debugging, allowing developers to focus on solving problems.eg Visual Studio Code (VS Code), pycharm.
VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It manages different versions of files, facilitating collaboration across distributed teams.eg Git, GitHub, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complex Codebases, Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technology, Dealing with Unclear or Changing Requirements, Balancing Speed and Quality, Collaborating with Non-Technical Stakeholders.
How to deal with the challenges
Maintain up-to-date documentation to help developers understand the codebase and onboard new team members more easily.
Engage in knowledge-sharing sessions with peers, participate in open-source projects, and join professional communities.
Use automated testing frameworks to regularly run tests, catching issues early in the development process.
Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential risks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or "units" of a software application in isolation. 
Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or units of the software. It ensures that the integrated modules work together as intended.
System testing involves testing the complete and integrated software application as a whole. It evaluates the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs, or "prompts," to guide the behavior and outputs of AI models, particularly language models like GPT. 
Importance of Prompt Engineering in Interacting with AI Models
Maximizing Output Quality
Controlling the Tone and Style
Optimizing for Specific Applications


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt Example:
"Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on healthcare, focusing on how AI is used to improve diagnostics and patient care."
The improved prompt is more effective because it guides the AI towards generating a response that is relevant, detailed, and aligned with the user's specific needs. This not only saves time but also enhances the quality and usefulness of the AI’s output.
